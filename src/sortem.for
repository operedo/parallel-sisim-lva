c                      Quickersort Subroutine
c                      **********************
c
c This is a subroutine for sorting a real array in ascending order. This
c is a Fortran translation of algorithm 271, quickersort, by R.S. Scowen
c in collected algorithms of the ACM.
c
c The method used is that of continually splitting the array into parts
c such that all elements of one part are less than all elements of the
c other, with a third part in the middle consisting of one element.  An
c element with value t is chosen arbitrarily (here we choose the middle
c element). i and j give the lower and upper limits of the segment being
c split.  After the split a value q will have been found such that 
c a(q)=t and a(l)<=t<=a(m) for all i<=l<q<m<=j.  The program then
c performs operations on the two segments (i,q-1) and (q+1,j) as follows
c The smaller segment is split and the position of the larger segment is
c stored in the lt and ut arrays.  If the segment to be split contains
c two or fewer elements, it is sorted and another segment is obtained
c from the lt and ut arrays.  When no more segments remain, the array
c is completely sorted.
